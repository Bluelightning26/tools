I hope to a ton of useful tools into one webpage,
this was originally on the index.html page but
I quickly realized that putting this in a markdown file would be better 

List of tools to make: (many will be fetching data from APIs and be live)

- [ ] weather
- [ ] flights
- [ ] airports
- [ ] currency exchange rates
- [ ] stock market data- around the world for diff markets?!?
- [ ] conversion rates ($, â‚¬, etc.)
- [ ] time zones (inc daylight savings time)
- [ ] unit conversion (length, weight, volume, etc.)
- [ x ] cdn adder
    - creates custom temp link for a file my server, uploads to hc cdn-> deletes from mine
- [ ] file converter (maybe?)
- [ ] file compressor (maybe?)
- [ ] where am i (using ip)
This is a starting point, and with more experience, and ideas I hope that this list will grow!
